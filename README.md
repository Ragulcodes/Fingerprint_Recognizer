# Fingerprint_Recognizer
Fingerprint matching using SIFT and FLANN with OpenCV to identify and display the best matching fingerprint from a set of images.

# Fingerprint Matching

This repository contains a Python script for fingerprint matching using the SIFT algorithm with OpenCV.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https: https://github.com/Ragulcodes/Fingerprint_Recognizer/tree/main
    cd Fingerprint_Recognizer
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python
    ```

## Usage

1. Place your sample fingerprint image in the `SOCOFing/Altered/Altered-Hard/` directory.
2. Place the real fingerprint images in the `SOCOFing/Real/` directory.
3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python Fingerprint_Recognizer.py
    ```
